# How to Set Up
This project was implemented on my macbook using:
- Xcode at the time. Any terminal with gcc installed will work
- Clone this repository 
- Open terminal at the codebase `~.../classic-games/game-codebase/`
- Run the `a.out` that is included or compile your own executable with the `main.cpp` and all other `file.cpp` files that are in the game folder
```zsh
g++ -o my_program main.cpp file.cpp
```
- Then use `./a.out` or `./my_program` depending on whatever you named your executable.






# Project Overview
This project utilizes 



## Project Details
In this project, I apply 


## BlackJack
I developed a Blackjack game in C that plays in the terminal. This included implementing game logic for dealing cards, calculating hand values, and determining game outcomes. The program utilized multiple files: main.c for the game loop and user interactions, functions.c for handling game logic and calculations, and functions.h for function declarations. Key accomplishments included designing a user-friendly interface, managing card shuffling and dealing, and implementing game rules to handle player decisions and dealer actions.


## Connect Four
In this we drew inspiration from various sources, including video tutorials online for 


## Craps 
I developed a Craps game in C that plays in the terminal. This included implementing the game logic for rolling dice, evaluating outcomes based on the rules of Craps, and managing game flow. The program was setup into different files: main.c for the game loop and user interactions, equations.c for handling game logic and calculations, and equations.h for function declarations. Key accomplishments included creating a user-friendly interface, managing random dice rolls adn betting system, and implementing the win/loss conditions of the game. 


## Yahtzee
This game involved developing a Yahtzee game using C. The code was setup into different files: main.c for the main game loop and user interaction, Equations.c for handling the game's calculations, and Equations.h for function declarations. Key accomplishments included designing an efficient scoring algorithm and ensuring smooth gameplay through user-friendly prompts and error handling.
